# Hate Speech Detection CSE158
This is a project completed for CSE 158 during Fall 2024 at UCSD.

I trained Logistic Regression and AdaBoost classifiers using Bag of Words and
word2vec features to detect hate speech with accuracies ranging from 0.817 - 0.829 on datasets sourced from Mendeley Data (originally found on kaggle).
